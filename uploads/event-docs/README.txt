EVENT DOCUMENTS FOLDER STRUCTURE
================================

To add documents for a race event:

1. Create a folder with the EVENT ID as the name
   Example: /uploads/event-docs/1/
            /uploads/event-docs/2/
            etc.

2. Drop your PDF/document files inside that folder

3. The files will automatically appear in the "Race Specific" tab 
   of the More Info modal on the website

FILE NAMING TIPS:
-----------------
The system automatically detects document types from filenames:

- Files with "SR", "Supplementary", or "Regulation" → Supplementary Regulations
- Files with "Entry" or "Entries" → Entry List  
- Files with "Time" or "Schedule" → Timetable
- Files with "Result" → Results
- Files with "Bulletin" → Bulletin
- Files with "Notice" → Notice
- Files with "Map" or "Layout" → Track Map

Example filenames:
- NATS1_Supplementary_Regulations.pdf
- Entry_List_Final.pdf
- Race_Timetable.pdf
- Track_Map.pdf

SUPPORTED FILE TYPES:
---------------------
- PDF (.pdf)
- Word (.doc, .docx)
- Excel (.xls, .xlsx)
- Images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg)

TO FIND YOUR EVENT ID:
----------------------
Check the admin panel → Events section, or look at the URL when 
editing an event. The event_id is shown in the event list.

NO DATABASE REQUIRED - Just drop files and they appear!
